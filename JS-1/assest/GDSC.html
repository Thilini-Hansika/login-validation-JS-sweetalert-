        <h1>GDSC</h1>
      <p>The GDSE program can be considered as the main qualification we offer at our institute. It is an amazing opportunity where the students are trained both theoretically and practically regarding the aspects that they may face in a career in software engineering. The ability to complete it within just two years of time is a huge benefit over all other leading IT education programs. Meanwhile, the content taught within this period is more valuable in comparison to a four year degree covering modules that are vital for the students to rise within the IT industry.<br><br>
      The course begins with an orientation program where the students are educated with the basic IT knowledge, this includes the usage of the Office package, an introduction to computer hardware .These basic facts are taught to the students during orientation sessions allowing students to familiarize themselves with the learning environment. Therefore this is a great opportunity for students who wish to enter a career in IT but are demotivated due to the lack of prior knowledge.<br><br>
      The recognition of this program in the industry is not to be questioned, with thousands of our students working in the industry, the quality of the education we provide has been proved over and over again making our students a set of highly sought after individuals. The acquisition of an affiliate position in the British Computer Society which is the Chartered Institute for IT in UK has further improved our position as an IT education provider. The completion of the GDSE program also makes our students eligible for the UK degree offered by the British Computer Society which is important for students who want to make further advancements in their careers by completing their Masters, etc. The success stories our students have written across the years reaching the highest positions of leading software companies is further proof of our competency where the completion of this program has led to the transformation of the lives of so many students who have entered IJSE.</p>
